## Business Problem
> Data source:[IMDB data](https://datasets.imdbws.com/),[Netflix Data](https://www.comparitech.com/blog/vpn-privacy/countries-netflix-cost/),[GDP](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/),[Wage Inequality Dataset](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/LM4OWF),[TOP 10 Netflix shows](https://top10.netflix.com/),[Netflix subscribers and revenue by country](https://www.comparitech.com/tv-streaming/netflix-subscribers/),[ISO Country Codes - Global](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andradaolteanu/iso-country-codes-global).

Netflix is an American subscription video-on-demand online streaming service launched in 2010, available in over 190 countries. <br>
GDP measures the monetary value of final goods and services—that is, those that are bought by the final user—produced in a country in a given period of time (say a quarter or a year). It counts all of the output generated within the borders of a country.<br>
How can netflix get more market in countries with a smaller GDP?

## Business Assumptions
It was assumed that Netflix wants more subscribers to increase its profitability and influence where it operates.

## Solution Strategy
In order to understand the problem, several databases were crossed to obtain a joint vision for better decision making.
For that I used:
* .csv files for data storage;
* RStudio for statistical analysis

## Data Insights
The main thesis is that the greater the GDP, the greater the number of subscribers and also the greater the profitability.<br>
However, this thesis turned out to be true to a certain extent.

## Business Results
In order for Netflix to perform better in countries with lower GDP, it will have to make some adjustments to its catalog and subscription prices.

## Conclusions
It is concluded that the trend in countries with higher GDP is a greater number of subscribers. However, the economy of the country also has great influence (developing country or developed country). <br>
For countries with less development, one way out would be to reduce the catalog, which is very extensive, so that the price of registrations can be reduced, and may even create a simpler registration model to enable this strategy.

## Next Steps
* Create a dashboard in Power BI
* Improve analysis to compare countries
* Understand the correlation between variables
